I want to learn how a JQuery Plug~In gets created, this is a candidate project.

For anyone who enjoys the *Abacus Device* Navigation Control from "Sharing159ofMillions.ca" site, the code in a
format not cluttered by the need to limit the action to 159/999 numbers as on that site; in other words, the
full simple code, will be posted here in a few days, as a starting point.

It is pure JavaScript, and doubtless can be refactored to improve it, but it works and is I imagine a starting
point for making the JQuery.
